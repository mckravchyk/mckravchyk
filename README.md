# Maciej Kravchyk

Full-stack (primarly front-end) engineer with 9 years of experience. I am proficient with TypeScript, I know how to build high-performance front-ends with React / Svelte, I care about good UX and designing interfaces that don't make people think. I  do not shy away from back-end work and also do general programming like writing libraries and command line utilities.

I write a programming blog [here](https://www.kravchyk.com).
